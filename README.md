# OpenCounty
The Open County Programme seeks to develop the platforms and mechanisms for three main purposes: to promote Open Government policy, to build tools for Open Government and to build appetite for citizen engagement.

The programme is building resource bases and knowledge for the local civil society organisations and community media to curate and manage data, to better analyse and communicate the data to their citizens.
